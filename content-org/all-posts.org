**** Increasing / Decreasing Test

- If $f'(x) > 0$ on an interval, then $f$ is increasing on that interval.

- If $f'(x) = 0$ on an interval, then $f$ is constant on that interval.

I forgot to mention that he is also an astrologer. The second paragraph of chapter two, "My Nativity" discusses his own horoscope (later in life he gets in trouble for casting the horoscope of Jesus).

  - Personal comment: it's been awhile since I've just sat with Cardano. Reading this now I'm reminded that he's a really repellant and truly toxic person. Fun story and big deal in history, but I am glad to not interact with him. - ... but, between complaints, discussing twenty-three years of lawsuits, and all, he gives a very broad list of things that make him happy and can bring happiness to everyone:

    #+begin_quote
    Let us live, therefore, cheerfully... if there is any good thing by which you would adorn this stage of life, we have not of such been cheated - rest, serenity, modesty, self-restraint, orderliness, change, fun, entertainment, society, temperance, sleep, food, drink, riding, sailing, walking, keeping abreast of events, meditation, contemplation, education, piety, marriage, feasting, the satisfaction of recalling an orderly disposition of the past, cleanliness, water, fire, listening to music, looking at all about one, talks, stories history, liberty, continence, little birds, puppies, cats, consolation of death, and the common flux of time, fate, and fortune, over the afflicted and favored alike. There is good in the hope for things beyond all hope; good in the exercise of some art in which one is skilled; good in meditating upon the manifold transmutation of all nature and upon the magnitude of the Earth. (pages 122-3)

  - Sketch 25: 3

Do you crochet? You can make a hyperbolic plane!

The pattern is incredibly simple: as long as you consistently increase the same for every row, you'll achieve a hyperbolic surface (constant negative curvature).

I've made several different increase counts. Let's do the simplest version:

1. Chain 20.
2. 4sc, inc.
3. repeat row 2 until it's as big as you want. The finished project will look like coral.

I wanted a "simple" way to write my class materials in Markdown. Hugo magically makes it a website.
{{{more}}}
I've been using Discourse for class content for about three years now - written in Markdown, I can easy mix text, math, and youtube videos and Discourse magically created the pre-class and post-class content pages. But of course that required students have a separate place to check for course materials, and I'm worried it wasn't viewed as often as I'd like.

Hugo takes Markdown and (almost) magically creates a static website. Nice!

In this post I'm going to document setting up the hugo blog for my course materials -- mostly for myself in case I need to recreate it in the future -- if you are reading this and are not me, let me know if it helps!

*** Basic setup of the hugo blog
... For this, look elsewhere and come back. (sorry)

Here's a [[https://github.com/jmhammond/math-courses][link to mine on GitHub]] with information about cloning and setting up.

*** Setting up Mathjax 3
There's really three things that need to happen to use Mathjax on a page:
1. You need to create a mathjax =partial=. This will live in ~site-name/layouts/partials/mathjax_support.html~:
      #+begin_src html
<script>
  MathJax = {
  tex: {
  packages: ['base', 'ams'],        // extensions to use
  inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ['\\(','\\)'] ],
  displayMath: [             // start/end delimiter pairs for display math
  ['$$', '$$'],
  ['\\[', '\\]']
  ],
  processEscapes: true,      // use \$ to produce a literal dollar sign
  processEnvironments: true, // process \begin{xxx}...\end{xxx} outside math mode
  formatError:               // function called when TeX syntax errors occur
  (jax, err) => jax.formatError(err)
  }
  };
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js">
</script>
   #+end_src

2. and then in the ~site-name/layouts/extend_head.html~ file, add the following:
   #+begin_src
{{ if .Params.mathjax }}{{ partial "mathjax_support.html" . }}{{ end }}
    #+end_src
    The conditional means that mathjax won't load on every page (since it does add overhead). It will only be on pages that request it.

3. To add mathjax to the page, you need to add the page parameter to the (toml) frontmatter: ~mathjax= true~.


*** Fonts and Colors
In order to match some of the [[https://www.wichita.edu/services/strategic_communications/brand_standards/colors_and_fonts.php][look and feel of the official WSU website]], I specified css files for hugo which automatically get picked up and used. For this, I created a ~fonts.css~ and ~custom.css~ file in the folder ~site-name/assets/css/extended~.

*** Spoiler shortcode
If you want to be able to hide an answer/solution so students need to click to reveal it,

#+begin_spoiler
... like this ...
#+end_spoiler

I've created a simple spoiler tag as a [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/][Hugo shortcode.]]  The above example was created by:

#+begin_src html
{{ < spoiler > }}
... like this ...
{{ </ spoiler > }}
#+end_src

Add this file to ~site-name/layouts/shortcodes/spoiler.html~
#+begin_src html
<div class="spoiler"><details {{ if (eq (.Get "openByDefault") true) }} open=true {{ end }}>
  <summary markdown="span">Click to reveal the answer.</summary>
  {{ .Inner | markdownify }}
</details></div>
#+end_src

and add this CSS to the ~site-name/assets/css/extended/custom.css~ file:
#+begin_src css
/* For the spoiler tags  */

.spoiler {
    margin: 0 5px 40px 5px;
    border: 1px solid var(--border);
    background: var(--entry);
    border-radius: var(--radius);
    padding: 0.4em;
}

.dark .spoiler {
    background: var(--entry);
}

.spoiler details summary {
    cursor: zoom-in;
    margin-inline-start: 20px;
}

.spoiler details[open] summary {
    cursor: zoom-out;
}

.spoiler .details {
    display: inline;
    font-weight: 500;
}

.spoiler .inner {
    margin: 0 20px;
    padding: 10px 20px;
}

.spoiler li ul {
    margin-inline-start: var(--gap);
}

.spoiler summary:focus {
    outline: 0;
}
#+end_src
