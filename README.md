# Hammond's Notes

This is a Hugo static site for my class pre-class content and blog posts. 

This will also serve as a base for any other hugo projects I explore for my classes. I'm currently using: 
- MathJax 3
- Support {{< spoiler >}} tags for hiding answers to questions
- Embedding youtube videos via the {{< youtube >}} shortcode
- Includes WSU default fonts, colors, and logos. 
- the markdown files are versioned to Github. 
- Github Actions CI/CD deploys the hugo (markdown) blog to Github pages.
- üêø


I'm using the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). For first time cloning, run this:
`git submodule update --init --recursive # needed when you reclone your repo (submodules may not get cloned automatically)`
