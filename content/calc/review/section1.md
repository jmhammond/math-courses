**Section 1.1 - Four Ways of Representing a Function**

Full disclosure: these videos are produced my another professor, and I'm including them here for review. 

The following videos are lecture videos covering the material from Section 1.1 in Stewart's Calculus 8th edition. Each major topic in the section is broken down into a short video.

The following video covers the fundamentals of functions including the basic definition and some visual examples.

Some functions have a property known as **symmetry.** In the context of functions, you have two main types of symmetry, but later in your mathematical careers you will see that other types of symmetry are possible. In any case, symmetry greatly reduces the complexity of a problem and simplifies our calculations.
