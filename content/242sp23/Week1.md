## 📅 Before class on Tuesday

Review the syllabus and come prepared to learn about "what in the world
is this class and how does it work?"

## Pre-requisite quiz solutions. 
Didn't get everything correct on the pre-req quiz? The questions you didn't get correct tell you exactly what *additional* material you need to be studying in order to succeed in calculus.

(we've written the pre-req quiz solutions during class on Day 2))

Remember that you're expected to work on average 3 hours per credit hour (15 hours per week) on this class, and be sure that you're *also* recovering and prerequisite algebra and trig skills you need to succeed!
