 Welcome to week 2! What do we do this week? 
<!--more-->

### Be on the lookout for checkpoints feedback!

They’re being marked and feedback is being given. I’ve slow to grade (as I’ve already said many times). When it’s done, you’ll find your feedback on Blackboard > Gradebook > Checkpoint 1.
I’ll also update the relevant learning target columns on Blackboard’s gradebook. [More information about where to find grades is in a video here](https://youtu.be/cjoz2SwNo70).
