## Be on the lookout for checkpoints feedback! {#be-on-the-lookout-for-checkpoints-feedback}

They're being marked and feedback is being given. I've slow to grade (as
I've already said many times). When it's done, you'll find your feedback
on Blackboard &gt; Gradebook &gt; Checkpoint 1. I'll also update the relevant
learning target columns on Blackboard's gradebook.
[More information about where to find grades is in a video here](https://youtu.be/cjoz2SwNo70).
