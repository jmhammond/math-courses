## This Week's Reading's and Assignments {#this-week-s-reading-s-and-assignments}

Before class tomorrow (for each day of class!), please complete the following:

Do you crochet? You can make a hyperbolic plane!

The pattern is incredibly simple: as long as you consistently increase the same for every row, you'll achieve a hyperbolic surface (constant negative curvature).

I've made several different increase counts. Let's do the simplest version:

1.  Chain 20.
2.  4sc, inc.
3.  repeat row 2 until it's as big as you want. The finished project will look like coral.

... actually... In lieu of a reading assignment, let me pose the following philosophical question - "What is math?"
