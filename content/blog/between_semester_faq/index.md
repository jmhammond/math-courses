Below are answers to some frequently asked questions I get between semesters.

### Are you teaching ___? 

Maybe? My Fall 2023 (current) schedule is: 

* Math 321 - Discrete Structures 1 in-person and online
    - for CS majors and secondary ed 
* Math 231 - "Discrete Mathematics" 
    - it's different than the other one.  
    - it's a new class we're running for the fall.
* Math 531 - History of Mathematics  
    - Yes, it is as awesome as you've heard.

### I'm on the waitlist, can you ___?

No.  I don't control the waitlist nor do I have any control over the number of seats allocated to my classes.

### Do you have a copy of the syllabus for ___? 

Not for the fall, but here's some old ones to give you a general idea: 

* [Math 321, Spring 2023](https://docs.google.com/document/d/103ekLxt2Phx-2Bah4LrgA5j9jkERJJZbJs8XJYBg1zY/edit)
* [Math 531, Fall 2022](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_F_Y2it0CnpK56b9yy-E7I9rDTpcay5lI3fTwhO72gs/edit)
* Math 231
    This is a new class that's never been taught before, but I hope to structure it like math 321 above, just with different content. I'll have a syllabus for by mid-August.
